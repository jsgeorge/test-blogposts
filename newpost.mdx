<p>Hello my fellow gophers, I hope all are well. The past year I've been studying and implementing a variety of different databases ( see here <Link href="https://github.com/guycipher">https://github.com/guycipher</Link>  ) and most recently I've gotten obsessed with building a relational database from the ground up, and sticking to it. I started writing AriaSQL about 7 months ago privately, studying the different concepts required to build such a system.</p>

<p>I'd like to share my current progress with the GO community. Mind you Aria is still in the beta stages and early stages of building a full fledged relational database system. Having a project like this, never stops. SQL is an old language, and being added to often enough where majority of systems don't implement the entire language nor all the features.</p>
